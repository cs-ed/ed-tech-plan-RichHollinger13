The main purpose of this Educational Technology Plan is to develop an approach to teaching AP Computer Science A in an effective and engaging way while being aware of the technological challenges that may arise from different software and hardware. Additionally, the plan is developed to maintain equity amongst students and encourage growth. 

## Context

### Course

This Educational Technology Plan is designed for AP Computer Science A, an advanced placement course targeting students in grades 10 through 12. The curriculum is rigorously focused on teaching coding fundamentals and the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm using the Java language. Instructional units cover complex technical concepts including classes, objects, inheritance, interfaces, and polymorphism. The primary objective is to equip students with the computational thinking skills necessary to succeed on the College Board AP examination administered in May, requiring a balance of theoretical understanding and practical application.

### Situation

The course is delivered in an in-person format at San Marino High School, utilizing a block schedule consisting of two 1 hour and 45 minute sessions per week followed by a "regular" schedule Friday which is a 50 minute class. While the current enrollment stands at 19 students, the technological and pedagogical planning is calibrated for a standard class size of 25-30 students to ensure scalability.

The demographic context of San Marino High School significantly influences the instructional design. Students typically come from affluent families characterized by high parental involvement and significant academic pressure. Furthermore, a substantial portion of the student body speaks Chinese as their primary language. This linguistic diversity necessitates specific instructional interventions to bridge language gaps and ensure equitable access to the curriculum.

Technologically, the district supports a 1:1 program providing Chromebooks to all students, while the classroom itself functions as a computer lab equipped with Apple desktop computers. The network infrastructure is generally strong; however, the plan accounts for occasional internet outages that occur approximately one to two times per year. Additionally, the district enforces strict IT policies, including firewalls and limitations on personal hardware, such as limited access to interenet page, and softwares. 

## Plan

### Software Specifications

The software ecosystem for the class is designed to operate within a mixed operating system environment, utilizing macOS for the classroom lab and Windows for student laptops.

**Development Environment (IDE)**
- The course will standardize on VS Code as the primary Integrated Development Environment. This choice exposes students to industry-standard tools immediately, making sure that students don't spend time learning something that they can not immediately apply or take with them after the class. 

**Assignments** 
- Assignment submission and portfolio management will be conducted entirely through GitHub. This ensures students gain proficiency in version control workflows essential for collegiate and professional software engineering.

**Learning Management System (LMS)**
- Schoology will function as the central hub for hosting course materials, submitting non-code assignments, and synchronizing grades. Additionally, Schoology will act as a resource library for students who may have missed class. Video lessons and completed notes will be provided on Schoology for self pacing when necessary. 

**Reinforcement & Content Creation**
- To maintain engagement under high academic pressure, gamified platforms such as Blooket will be used for syntax reinforcement. For instructional content, iMovie will be utilized to create recorded walkthroughs and provide video-based feedback. Additionally Good Notes on the Ipad will be used for note projection/completed notes PDFs.

### Hardware Specifications

The hardware requirements are selected to support high-performance multitasking, specifically the ability to compile Java code while simultaneously rendering video content for instruction.

**Instructor Workstation** 
- The instructor will utilize a MacBook Pro 13-inch equipped with an Apple M4 CPU, 24 GB of RAM, and a 1 TB hard drive. These high-performance specifications are critical to prevent latency during live coding demonstrations and to support the storage and editing of large video files. The Macbook will be able to connect to an Apple TV to project live demonstrations. Additionally the teacher will use an M4 Ipad Pro connected to the Apple Tv for any guided notes that need to be shown. 

**Student Workstation**
- The learning environment for students features a hybrid setup of school-provided M1 Mac desk top computers and Acer Swift 514 laptops. The Acer units are specified with a Ryzen 3 chip, 8 GB of LPDDR5X RAM, and NVMe SSD storage. These specifications are the minimum required to compile Java applications efficiently without hardware-induced delays.

**Network**
The classroom infrastructure supports both Wi-Fi and Ethernet connections. Students will use the School's Students Wifi and the teacher will use the School's Staff Wifi.

### Application

The pedagogical approach prioritizes the visualization of abstract concepts. During lectures, the instructor will utilize a Ipad and Apple Pencil to annotate presentation materials in real-time. This strategy allows for manual walkthroughs of multi-step logic and algorithms, enabling students to visualize the flow of execution rather than relying solely on static text.

To complete this visual approach guided notes will be designed minimistically with diagrams that can be annotated in real time. The guided notes will have minimal text. The guided notes will additionally have syntax that students can annotate with corrections or additions. This adheres to evidence-based multimedia learning principles (specifically the Coherence Principle), preventing cognitive overload and ensuring students focus their attention on the instructor's verbal explanation and handwritten diagrams.

**Collaboration**
- Collaborative learning is structured through group work where students will work together on larger coding projects to brainstorm ideas, choose a pathway to the desired result, and decide how each memeber of the group can code an individual part of the larger project so that their code integrates seamlessly with the rest of the group. Additionally students will perform Peer instruction where they will be given questions, asked to formulate an answer, and then convince other students around them that their answer is correct. This strategy will allow students to engage with the content on a deeper level then a traditional lecture format. Students will also perform pair programming during block schedule classes when they are working on smaller coding assignments. Students in a pair will alternate between the coder and the non coder. This method allows students to work with the material in a variety of modalities. One student will be listening, processing, and typing syntax, while the other student will be planning, developing, and communicating their ideas. The combination of smaller pair assigned daily tasks as well as larger group projects will lead to a collaborative environment in the class. 

**Assessment**
- Assessment workflows are streamlined to provide timely feedback in a high-pressure environment. Assignments are uploaded to the LMS or GitHub, where auto-grading scripts provide immediate "quick check" feedback on syntax and basic functionality. For Summative assessment, the instructor will provide feedback via 1 on 1 conference presentations. This method allows the instructor to listen for critical thinking, project management, and basic computer science principles. With AI on the rise these 1 on 1 conferences will aim to assess not only the ability for the student to complete the project but also their understanding of the process they took to complete it. 

### Impacts

**Inclusion and Accessibility**
- The technological choices in this plan directly address the needs of the diverse student population at San Marino High School. The implementation of recorded video feedback and instructional walkthroughs serves as a critical scaffolding tool for English Learners, particularly the significant population of Chinese speakers. These recordings function as a "rewind" mechanism, allowing students to review complex technical explanations and English terminology at their own pace until comprehension is achieved. This ensures that language barriers do not impede mastery of computer science concepts.


**Resiliency and Contingency**
- The plan integrates significant resiliency against disruptions. By leveraging cloud-based platforms like GitHub and Schoology, the course is "future-proofed" against potential transitions to hybrid or virtual learning. In the event of campus closures, the curriculum can continue with minimal disruption as all code repositories, assignment prompts, and submission portals remain accessible from any location with internet access.

**Ethical Considerations**
- Finally, the plan leverages technology to address ethical standards in computing. The use of GitHub provides a practical framework for teaching privacy models and data protection. Students will learn the critical distinction between open-source public repositories and proprietary private repositories. This comprehensive approach ensures students are not only technically proficient but also ethically responsible digital citizens.
