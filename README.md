# Educational Technology Plan

Teach Fundamentals & OOP: The main purpose is to teach coding fundamentals and dive into the object-oriented programming paradigm using the Java language.

AP Exam Preparation: A secondary purpose is to prepare students to score well on the AP Computer Science exam administered in May.

## Context

### Course

This Educational Technology Plan is designed for AP Computer Science A, an advanced placement course targeting students in grades 10 through 12. The curriculum is rigorously focused on teaching coding fundamentals and the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm using the Java language. Instructional units cover complex technical concepts including classes, objects, inheritance, interfaces, and polymorphism. The primary objective is to equip students with the computational thinking skills necessary to succeed on the College Board AP examination administered in May, requiring a balance of theoretical understanding and practical application.

### Situation

The course is delivered in an in-person format at San Marino High School, utilizing a block schedule consisting of two 50-minute sessions per week. While the current enrollment stands at 19 students, the technological and pedagogical planning is calibrated for a standard class size of 20 to 25 students to ensure scalability.

The demographic context of San Marino High School significantly influences the instructional design. Students typically come from affluent families characterized by high parental involvement and significant academic pressure. Furthermore, a substantial portion of the student body speaks Chinese as their primary language. This linguistic diversity necessitates specific instructional interventions to bridge language gaps and ensure equitable access to the curriculum.

Technologically, the district supports a 1:1 program providing Chromebooks to all students, while the classroom itself functions as a computer lab equipped with Apple desktop computers. The network infrastructure is generally robust; however, the plan accounts for occasional internet outages that occur approximately one to two times per year. Additionally, the district enforces strict IT policies, including firewalls and limitations on "Bring Your Own Device" (BYOD) usage, which restricts the implementation of personal student hardware.

## Plan

### Software Specifications

The software ecosystem for the class is designed to operate within a mixed operating system environment, utilizing macOS for the classroom lab and Windows for student laptops.

Development Environment (IDE): The course will standardize on VS Code as the primary Integrated Development Environment. This choice exposes students to industry-standard tools immediately, moving beyond educational sandboxes to professional-grade software.


Version Control: Assignment submission and portfolio management will be conducted entirely through GitHub. This ensures students gain proficiency in version control workflows essential for collegiate and professional software engineering.


Learning Management System (LMS): Schoology will function as the central hub for hosting course materials, submitting non-code assignments, and synchronizing grades.


Reinforcement & Content Creation: To maintain engagement under high academic pressure, gamified platforms such as Blooket will be used for syntax reinforcement. For instructional content, iMovie and OBS will be utilized to create recorded walkthroughs and provide video-based feedback, while PowerPoint will be used for lecture delivery.

### Hardware Specifications

The hardware requirements are selected to support high-performance multitasking, specifically the ability to compile Java code while simultaneously rendering video content for instruction.

Instructor Workstation: The instructor will utilize a MacBook Pro 13-inch equipped with an Apple M4 CPU, 24 GB of RAM, and a 1 TB hard drive. These high-performance specifications are critical to prevent latency during live coding demonstrations and to support the storage and editing of large video files. The workstation connects to a suite of peripherals including an external monitor, a projector, and a TV screen to ensure code visibility for all students. A document camera is also integrated to facilitate the display of handwritten code traces.

Student Workstations: The learning environment features a hybrid setup of school-provided M1 Macs and Acer Swift 514 laptops. The Acer units are specified with a Ryzen 3 chip, 8 GB of LPDDR5X RAM, and NVMe SSD storage. These specifications are the minimum required to compile Java applications efficiently without hardware-induced delays.

Network: The classroom infrastructure supports both Wi-Fi and Ethernet connections. While student devices will primarily utilize Wi-Fi, the instructor station will utilize Ethernet to ensure stability during critical instructional delivery.

### Application

The pedagogical approach prioritizes the visualization of abstract concepts. During lectures, the instructor will utilize a tablet and stylus to annotate presentation materials in real-time. This strategy allows for manual walkthroughs of multi-step logic and algorithms (e.g., loop iterations or inheritance hierarchies), enabling students to visualize the flow of execution rather than relying solely on static text.

To complement this visual approach, presentation slides will be designed as "light" slides, characterized by minimal text and reduced visual clutter. This adheres to evidence-based multimedia learning principles (specifically the Coherence Principle), preventing cognitive overload and ensuring students focus their attention on the instructor's verbal explanation and handwritten diagrams.

Collaborative learning is structured through group work where students "divide and conquer" larger coding challenges, as well as through pair programming exercises. These activities foster peer-to-peer learning and develop essential technical communication skills.

Assessment workflows are streamlined to provide timely feedback in a high-pressure environment. Assignments are uploaded to the LMS or GitHub, where auto-grading scripts provide immediate "quick check" feedback on syntax and basic functionality. For qualitative assessment, the instructor will provide feedback via recorded video clips. This method allows the instructor to narrate the review of a student's code, highlighting specific logic errors and offering personalized corrective guidance.

### Impacts

Inclusion and Accessibility
The technological choices in this plan directly address the needs of the diverse student population at San Marino High School. The implementation of recorded video feedback and instructional walkthroughs serves as a critical scaffolding tool for English Learners, particularly the significant population of Chinese speakers. These recordings function as a "rewind" mechanism, allowing students to review complex technical explanations and English terminology at their own pace until comprehension is achieved. This ensures that language barriers do not impede mastery of computer science concepts.


Resiliency and Contingency
The plan integrates significant resiliency against disruptions. By leveraging cloud-based platforms like GitHub and Schoology, the course is "future-proofed" against potential transitions to hybrid or virtual learning. In the event of campus closures, the curriculum can continue with minimal disruption as all code repositories, assignment prompts, and submission portals remain accessible from any location with internet access.

Ethical Considerations
Finally, the plan leverages technology to address ethical standards in computing. The use of GitHub provides a practical framework for teaching privacy models and data protection. Students will learn the critical distinction between open-source public repositories and proprietary private repositories, ensuring they understand how to manage their digital footprint in compliance with FERPA and COPPA standards. This comprehensive approach ensures students are not only technically proficient but also ethically responsible digital citizens.
